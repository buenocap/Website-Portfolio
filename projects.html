                    <p>This project is an API I made using NodeJS and Express. It uses a method of budgeting using "envelopes". Which essentially involves different categories that relate to certain events in your life where you can decide where to invest/save your money.</p>

                    <p>This project is coded in python. It's a simple game that can be ran in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. In the game's current state it runs in the terminal and two players can play against each other. Currently I am working on creating an AI that the user can play against.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;Scavenger Hunt is a 3D first person game. Where the objective is to locate items that are randomly placed around the map. In the map you will also find portals that will lead you to puzzle rooms which award the player with a bonus item upon successful completion of the puzzle. What makes Scavenger Hunt interesting is it is also a procedurally generated game meaning the map generated will almost never be the same twice.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;This was a year long project where we worked closely with a client in order to make their vision come true. This is where I gained real world experience of the Software Development Cycle. My team rotated team leader every so often throughout the year. I took lead at the beginning of the project. During this time I established deadlines, assigning tasks, setting up weekly meetings with the client, and drafting reports that would keep the client up to date with any progess on a weekly basis. I also took lead during the end of the project where I finalized project documentation, established a techonology transfer meeting giving the client the neccessary credentials to continue working on this project, this included giving a through breakdown of the different components of the game and how it worked as a whole. This game was created using Unity.</p>

                        <h3>My Role:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was in charge of developing the algorithm that would generate the game map. The map uses perlin noise to create waves which determines which areas are hills and flat lands.</li>
                            <li>Another task I was assigned was generating the different biomes.In order to achieve this I used the map heights as a threshold in conjuction with perlin noise to determine the different biomes.</li>
                            <li>I took lead in creating an algorithm that would randomly place the assets such as the different trees as well as the items that needed to be found. Luckily a lot of the code I used could be repurposed for this algorithm.</li>
