                    <p>This project is an API I made using NodeJS and Express. It uses a method of budgeting using "envelopes". Which essentially involves different categories that relate to certain events in your life where you can decide where to invest/save your money.</p>

                    <p>This project is coded in python. It's a simple game that can be ran in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. In the game's current state it runs in the terminal and two players can play against each other. Currently I am working on creating an AI that the user can play against.</p>

                        <p>Scavenger Hunt is a 3D first person game. Where the objective is to locate items that are randomly placed around the map. In the map you will also find portals that will lead you to puzzle rooms which award the player with a bonus item upon successful completion of the puzzle. What makes Scavenger Hunt interesting is it is also a procedurally generated game meaning the map generated will almost never be the same twice. This game was created using Unity.<br><br>
                        <h3>My Role:</h3>
                        I was in charge of developing the algorithm that would generate the game map. The map uses perlin noise to create waves which determines which areas are hills and flat lands.
                        <br>Another task I was assigned was generating the different biomes.In order to achieve this I used the map heights as a threshold in conjuction with perlin noise to determine the different biomes.
                        <br>Another major task I took lead in was developing a random item placement.
