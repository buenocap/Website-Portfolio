                        <p>&emsp;I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Denver. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and a certification in Cybersecurity and Secure Computing. During my time in school I explored many areas of computer science such as Web Development, Data Analysis, Video Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity. I have gained and learned knowledge on several concepts and I loved it. All of it. Not only have I worked with and learned about software. I have also worked with hardware components mainly in the area of IoT devices. I'm familiar with working with Arduinos and creating code for them.<br>

                        <br>&emsp;I enjoy coding and programming in general and as you can see, I like to explore different fields in Computer Science. Above all, I love learning and since technology is always evolving; there's always something new to learn. I have a deep appreciation for software and technology as a whole; it's helped mankind advance in many ways and I want to be apart of that. Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio!<br>
                        
                        <br>&emsp;In my free time I enjoy reading horror books mainly those by Stephen King. I am really big on movies! I enjoy watching superhero movies, action, adventure, horror, sci-fi, etc. True Crime podcasts are my go to on slow days when there isn't much to do.

                        <p>Scavenger Hunt is a 3D first person game. Where the objective is to locate items that are randomly placed around the map. In the map you will also find portals that will lead you to puzzle rooms which award the player with a bonus item upon successful completion of the puzzle. What makes Scavenger Hunt interesting is it is also a procedurally generated game meaning the map generated will almost never be the same twice.</p>
