          <p class="body-text">
            I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Denver. I
            graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and a
            certification in Cybersecurity and Secure Computing. During my time
            in school I explored many areas of computer science such as Web
            Development, Data Analysis, Video Game Design, Artificial
            Intelligence, and Cybersecurity. I have gained and learned knowledge
            on several concepts and I loved it. All of it. Not only have I
            worked with and learned about software. I have also worked with
            hardware components mainly in the area of IoT devices. I'm familiar
            with working with Arduinos and creating code for them.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            I enjoy coding and programming in general and as you can see, I like
            to explore different fields in Computer Science. Above all, I love
            learning and since technology is always evolving; there's always
            something new to learn. I have a deep appreciation for software and
            technology as a whole; it's helped mankind advance in many ways and
            I want to be apart of that. Thank you for taking the time to view my
            portfolio!
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            In my free time I enjoy reading horror books mainly those by Stephen
            King. I am really big on movies! I enjoy watching superhero movies,
            action, adventure, horror, sci-fi, etc. True Crime podcasts are my
            go to on slow days when there isn't much to do.

            Scavenger Hunt is a 3D first person game. Where the objective is to
            locate items that are randomly placed around the map. In the map you
            will also find portals that will lead you to puzzle rooms which
            award the player with a bonus item upon successful completion of the
            puzzle. What makes Scavenger Hunt interesting is it is also a
            procedurally generated game meaning the map generated will almost
            never be the same twice.
